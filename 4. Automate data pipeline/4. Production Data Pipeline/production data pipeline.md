## Airflow Plugins
Airflow was built with the intention of allowing its users to extend and customize its functionality through plugins. The most common types of user-created plugins for Airflow are Operators and Hooks. These plugins make DAGs reusable and simpler to maintain. We can create our custom operators like below
```
import logging
from airflow.hooks.postgres_hook import PostgresHook
from airflow.models import BaseOperator
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults

class HasRowsOperator(BaseOperator):

    @apply_defaults
    def __init__(self,
                 redshift_conn_id="",
                 table="",
                 *args, **kwargs):

        super(HasRowsOperator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.table = table
        self.redshift_conn_id = redshift_conn_id

    def execute(self, context):
        redshift_hook = PostgresHook(self.redshift_conn_id)
        records = redshift_hook.get_records(f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {self.table}")
        if len(records) < 1 or len(records[0]) < 1:
            raise ValueError(f"Data quality check failed. {self.table} returned no results")
        num_records = records[0][0]
        if num_records < 1:
            raise ValueError(f"Data quality check failed. {self.table} contained 0 rows")
        logging.info(f"Data quality on table {self.table} check passed with {records[0][0]} records")

```
`execute` function will be executed when that operator will be called.
