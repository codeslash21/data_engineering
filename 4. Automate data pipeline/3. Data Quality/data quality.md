## Data Lineage
The data lineage of a dataset describes the discrete steps involved in the creation, movement, and calculation of that dataset.

### Why is Data Lineage important?
- **Instilling Confidence:** Being able to describe the data lineage of a particular dataset or analysis will build confidence in data consumers (engineers, analysts, data scientists, etc.) that our data pipeline is creating meaningful results using the correct datasets. If the data lineage is unclear, its less likely that the data consumers will trust or use the data.
- **Defining Metrics:** Another major benefit of surfacing data lineage is that it allows everyone in the organization to agree on the definition of how a particular metric is calculated.
- **Debugging:** Data lineage helps data engineers track down the root of errors when they occur. If each step of the data movement and transformation process is well described, it's easy to find problems when they occur.
