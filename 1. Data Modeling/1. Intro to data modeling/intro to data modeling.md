# Introduction to data modeling
A database is a structured repository or collection of data that is stored and retrieved electronically for use in applications. Data can be stored, updated, or deleted from a database. And the software used to access the database by the user and application is the database management system (DBMS).

## Data Model
Data model is an abstraction that organise the elements of data and how they will relate to each other. Data modeling is the process of creating data models for an information system. Data modeling starts from conceptual data modeling

## Why Data Modeling Important
The organization of the data for your applications is extremely important and makes everyone's life easier. Having a well thought out and organized data model is critical to how that data can later be used. Queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become complicated queries if data modeling isn't well thought out. Data modeling is not a fixed process. It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced. Having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.
